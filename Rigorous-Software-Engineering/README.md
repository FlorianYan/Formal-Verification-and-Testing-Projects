This repository contains my solutions to the final project task of the "Rigorous Software Engineering" class at ETH Zurich. My team successfully passed the pipeline and achieved a test coverage of over 78%.

## Overview
In the following project,  we will use **Program Analysis** to verify 3 properties of JAVA programs. In particular, we will use **Abstract Interpretation** and **Pointer Analysis** with APRON and SOOT as well as rigorous **Testing** to reason about the programs.

## Licence
This project is co-authored by the SRI Lab at ETH Zurich and my teammates.
